# fr0g-ai-registry TODO

## AI CODE GENERATION GUIDELINES - REGISTRY COMPONENT

### ESSENTIAL CONTEXT FILES FOR THIS COMPONENT
**ALWAYS ADD THESE FILES TO AI CHAT CONTEXT:**
- `README.md` (project overview and component boundaries)
- `docker-compose.yml` (service configuration)
- `Makefile` (build commands)
- `.env.example` (configuration template)
- `fr0g-ai-registry/TODO.md` (THIS FILE - current status)

### COMPONENT BOUNDARY RULES
- **FOCUS AREA**: Only work on `fr0g-ai-registry/` directory and files
- **SERVICE ROLE**: Service discovery, registration, and health monitoring
- **PORTS**: HTTP :8500 (configured in docker-compose)
- **DEPENDENCIES**: Standalone service, provides discovery to all other services

### CROSS-COMPONENT INTERACTION RULES
- **DO NOT** edit files in other component directories
- **DO NOT** modify other components' TODO.md files
- **ASK FIRST** if you need to modify shared files (docker-compose.yml, Makefile, etc.)
- **BE AWARE** that all other services depend on this registry for service discovery

### PROJECT STRUCTURE RULES
- **Repository URL**: Always use `https://github.com/fr0g-vibe/fr0g-ai`
- **Project Path**: All Go imports use `github.com/fr0g-vibe/fr0g-ai/` prefix
- **Working Directory**: AI agents start in `/fr0g-ai` root directory (local clone)
- **Module Navigation**: Already in fr0g-ai-registry/ directory (set by tmux session)
- **Service Ports**: HTTP :8500 (configured in docker-compose)
- **Subproject Path**: This component exists at `github.com/fr0g-vibe/fr0g-ai/fr0g-ai-registry`
- **Working Directory**: Already in component directory (fr0g-ai-registry/)

### NO MOCKING POLICY - REGISTRY COMPONENT
- **NEVER CREATE MOCKS**: Always implement real functionality, never mock implementations
- **REAL SERVICE DISCOVERY**: Implement actual service registration and discovery
- **REAL HEALTH CHECKING**: Implement actual health monitoring, not fake status
- **REAL PERSISTENCE**: Implement actual service state persistence
- **PRODUCTION READY**: All registry functionality must be production-ready

### CODE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS - REGISTRY COMPONENT
- **MANDATORY LINTING**: Always run `make lint` before committing any code changes
- **ZERO LINT ERRORS**: All code must pass golangci-lint without errors or warnings
- **FIX BEFORE COMMIT**: Never commit code that fails linting - fix all issues first
- **LINT EARLY**: Run `make lint` frequently during development, not just at the end
- **SHARED CONFIG**: Use centralized configuration from `pkg/config/` to avoid import errors

### SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK RULES - REGISTRY COMPONENT
- **QUADRUPLE BACKTICKS**: Always use ```` as fences, never triple backticks ```
- **FULL FILE PATH**: Use complete file path alone on first line, no formatting
- **EXACT MATCHING**: SEARCH section must match existing content character-for-character
- **CONCISE BLOCKS**: Keep blocks small, include only changing lines plus context
- **UNIQUE MATCHING**: Include enough surrounding lines for unique identification
- **MULTIPLE BLOCKS**: Use separate blocks for multiple changes in same file

### 🚨 CRITICAL SAFETY RULES - REGISTRY COMPONENT 🚨
- **🚫 NEVER EXECUTE PKILL**: NEVER EVER run pkill, killall, kill -9, or ANY process termination commands
- **🚫 NEVER KILL PROCESSES**: NEVER attempt to kill processes directly through system commands
- **🚫 NO DESTRUCTIVE FILE OPERATIONS**: NEVER run rm -rf, mv without confirmation, or delete important files
- **🚫 NO DESTRUCTIVE GIT COMMANDS**: NEVER run git reset --hard, git clean -fd, git push --force without explicit approval
- **🚫 NO FORCE OPERATIONS**: NEVER suggest destructive operations without stopping and asking first
- **COMPLETED USE START/STOP SCRIPTS ONLY**: ONLY use designated start and stop scripts for process management
- **COMPLETED ASK BEFORE DESTRUCTIVE OPERATIONS**: ALWAYS pause and ask before ANY potentially destructive operations
- **COMPLETED GRACEFUL SHUTDOWN ONLY**: Always use proper service shutdown mechanisms and scripts
- **COMPLETED VERIFY BEFORE EXECUTION**: Double-check ALL system commands before suggesting them
- **COMPLETED PAUSE FOR DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS**: Always pause and ask before any destructive operations
- **COMPLETED COMMIT FREQUENTLY**: Use frequent git commits for version control instead of manual backups

### CENTRALIZED CONFIGURATION RULES - REGISTRY COMPONENT
- **MANDATORY**: Use `pkg/config/` for ALL configuration and validation needs
- **NO LOCAL CONFIG**: Never create registry-specific config/validation libraries
- **EXTEND SHARED**: Embed shared config types, add registry-specific fields as needed
- **VALIDATION STANDARD**: Use `sharedconfig.ValidationErrors` for all validation
- **IMPORT PATTERN**: Always `import sharedconfig "pkg/config"`
- **CONTRIBUTE SPECIALIZED**: Add registry-specific validation to `pkg/config/` when needed
- **NO DUPLICATION**: Never reimplement port, timeout, or other validation already in shared config
- **LOADER USAGE**: Use `sharedconfig.NewLoader()` for configuration loading
