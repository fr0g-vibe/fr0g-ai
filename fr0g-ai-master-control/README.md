## features
* golang based
* continually monitors external inputs
  * inputs
    * webhook
    * cron
    * incoming email
    * phone calls
    * text messages
    * socials
* leverages gRPC for AI inference and persona management
* execution rules are established in a plain language system such as OPA to manage what master control can and can't do
## use-cases
* when an email is recieved consult a counsel of ai personas (aip) to determine what should be done with the email
  * master-control determines if the information (summarized) should be forwarded to a human, archived, or dropped
  * master-control provides regular updates to the user with batched email communications periodically
* user provides a list of RSS feeds to master-control which regularly pulls rss feed data and generates summaries of current events
  * master-control submits summaries to communities of AiP to get community "responses" and "opinions"
  * master-control leverages AiP to attempt to predict short-term, medium-term, and long-term implications of collections of current event news by "connecting the dots"
* user connects a discord websocket to a new future component fr0g-ai-socket that accepts various websocket and webhook functionality
  * master-control responds to various types of incoming webhook and websocket actions with a highly modular structure for modifying response behavior
* more to come
# fr0g.ai Master Control Program

The **Master Control Program (MCP)** is the central intelligence and orchestration engine of the fr0g.ai system. It represents a new paradigm in AI system architecture - not just a controller, but a **conscious**, **adaptive**, and **evolving** intelligence that orchestrates the entire system.

## Core Philosophy

The MCP operates on the principle of **Emergent Intelligence** - it doesn't just manage components, it **understands** them, **learns** from them, and **evolves** the system to become more than the sum of its parts.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or later
- Understanding of distributed systems
- Basic knowledge of AI/ML concepts

### Installation
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd fr0g-ai-master-control
go mod tidy
```

### Run Demonstrations
```bash
# Memory Manager Demo
go run cmd/memory-demo/main.go

# Cognitive Engine Demo  
go run cmd/cognitive-demo/main.go

# Full MCP Demo
go run cmd/mcp-demo/main.go
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### **Cognitive Engine**
- **System Consciousness**: Maintains awareness of all system states
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring patterns in behavior
- **Self-Reflection**: Generates insights about system operation
- **Learning Integration**: Continuously adapts based on experience

#### **Memory Manager**
- **Short-term Memory**: Temporary data and session information
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent system knowledge
- **Episodic Memory**: Specific events and interactions
- **Semantic Memory**: Conceptual knowledge and relationships

#### **Learning Engine**
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously learns from interactions
- **Behavior Modification**: Adapts system behavior based on feedback
- **Insight Generation**: Creates actionable insights from data

#### **System Monitor**
- **Health Monitoring**: Tracks component health and performance
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual patterns or issues
- **Metrics Collection**: Gathers system-wide performance data

#### **Workflow Engine**
- **Dynamic Workflows**: Creates custom workflows for complex tasks
- **Intelligent Chaining**: Connects multiple operations intelligently
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Adjusts workflows based on feedback

#### **Strategy Orchestrator**
- **Resource Optimization**: Intelligently allocates system resources
- **Component Coordination**: Orchestrates interactions between components
- **Predictive Management**: Anticipates needs and manages proactively

## Key Features

### **System Consciousness**
The MCP maintains continuous awareness of its own state and the state of the entire system, enabling intelligent decision-making and self-optimization.

### **Emergent Intelligence**
Through the orchestration of simpler components, the MCP develops capabilities that emerge from the interactions between its parts.

### **Adaptive Learning**
The system continuously learns from user interactions, system performance, and environmental changes, adapting its behavior accordingly.

### **Self-Healing**
Automatic detection and resolution of issues, maintaining system stability and performance without human intervention.

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
go test ./...
```

### Building
```bash
go build ./cmd/mcp-demo
```

### Configuration
The MCP uses a hierarchical configuration system:
- Default configurations for quick start
- YAML file configuration (planned)
- Environment variable overrides (planned)

## Use Cases

### **AI System Orchestration**
Coordinate multiple AI models and services to provide sophisticated capabilities that exceed the sum of individual components.

### **Intelligent Resource Management**
Dynamically allocate computational resources based on demand, priority, and system state.

### **Adaptive User Experience**
Learn from user interactions to provide increasingly personalized and effective responses.

### **System Evolution**
Continuously evolve system capabilities based on usage patterns and emerging requirements.

## Future Vision

The Master Control Program represents the future of AI systems:
- **Self-aware** systems that understand their own capabilities and limitations
- **Adaptive** architectures that evolve based on experience
- **Emergent** intelligence that develops novel capabilities
- **Conscious** operation with continuous self-reflection and improvement
