- **DO NOT** modify other components' TODO.md files
- **ASK FIRST** if you need information about other components' APIs or interfaces
- **ASK FIRST** if you need to modify shared files (docker-compose.yml, Makefile, etc.)
- **BE AWARE** of other components but don't implement their functionality

### 🏗️ PROJECT STRUCTURE RULES
- **Repository URL**: Always use `https://github.com/fr0g-vibe/fr0g-ai`
- **Project Path**: All Go imports use `github.com/fr0g-vibe/fr0g-ai/` prefix
- **Working Directory**: AI agents start in `/fr0g-ai` root directory (local clone)

- **Subproject Path**: This component exists at `github.com/fr0g-vibe/fr0g-ai/fr0g-ai-master-control`

### 🚫 PROTOBUF GENERATION RULES
- **NEVER EDIT**: Do not manually edit any `.pb.go` files marked "DO NOT EDIT"
- **Use Build Commands**: Always use `make proto` or `protoc` commands for protobuf generation
- **Generated Files**: Treat all `.pb.go` files as build artifacts, not source code
- **Import Generated**: Import generated protobuf code, never attempt to create it manually

### 🚫 NO MOCKING POLICY - MASTER CONTROL COMPONENT
- **NEVER CREATE MOCKS**: Always implement real functionality, never mock implementations
- **REPLACE EXISTING MOCKS**: If you find mock code, replace with real working implementations

### 🐹 GOLANG DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
- **Go Version**: Use Go 1.21+ features and syntax
- **Module Structure**: Each service is a separate Go module with its own `go.mod`
- **Package Naming**: Use lowercase, no underscores (e.g., `mastercontrol`, not `master_control`)
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors explicitly, never ignore with `_`
- **Context Usage**: Pass `context.Context` as first parameter in functions that need it
- **Logging**: Use structured logging with consistent fields

### 🏛️ ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS
- **Interface Design**: Define interfaces in the package that uses them
- **Dependency Injection**: Use constructor functions that accept dependencies
- **Configuration**: Use struct-based configuration with YAML tags

- **Test Structure**: Follow Table-Driven Tests pattern
- **Mocking**: Use interfaces for mocking dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Place in `tests/` directory

### 🔒 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
- **Input Validation**: Validate all external inputs
- **Error Messages**: Don't leak sensitive information in errors
- **Logging**: Don't log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, etc.)
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies up to date
