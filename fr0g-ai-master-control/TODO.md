- `docker-compose.yml` (service configuration)
- `Makefile` (build commands)
- `.env.example` (configuration template)
- `fr0g-ai-master-control/TODO.md` (THIS FILE - current status)

### COMPONENT BOUNDARY RULES
- **FOCUS AREA**: Only work on `fr0g-ai-master-control/` directory and files
- **SERVICE ROLE**: Orchestration, cognitive processing, threat vector processing
- **PORTS**: HTTP :8081 (configured in docker-compose)
- **DEPENDENCIES**: Can call fr0g-ai-aip via gRPC, service registry integration

### CROSS-COMPONENT INTERACTION RULES
- **DO NOT** edit files in `fr0g-ai-aip/` or `fr0g-ai-bridge/` directories
- **DO NOT** modify other components' TODO.md files
- **ASK FIRST** if you need information about other components' APIs or interfaces
- **ASK FIRST** if you need to modify shared files (docker-compose.yml, Makefile, etc.)
- **BE AWARE** of other components but don't implement their functionality

### PROJECT STRUCTURE RULES
- **Repository URL**: Always use `https://github.com/fr0g-vibe/fr0g-ai`
- **Project Path**: All Go imports use `github.com/fr0g-vibe/fr0g-ai/` prefix
- **Working Directory**: AI agents start in `/fr0g-ai` root directory (local clone)
- **Module Navigation**: MUST `cd fr0g-ai-master-control` before running Go commands
- **Service Ports**: HTTP :8081 (configured in docker-compose)
- **Subproject Path**: This component exists at `github.com/fr0g-vibe/fr0g-ai/fr0g-ai-master-control`

### PROTOBUF GENERATION RULES
- **NEVER EDIT**: Do not manually edit any `.pb.go` files marked "DO NOT EDIT"
- **Use Build Commands**: Always use `make proto` or `protoc` commands for protobuf generation
- **Generated Files**: Treat all `.pb.go` files as build artifacts, not source code
- **Import Generated**: Import generated protobuf code, never attempt to create it manually

### NO MOCKING POLICY - MASTER CONTROL COMPONENT
- **NEVER CREATE MOCKS**: Always implement real functionality, never mock implementations
- **REPLACE EXISTING MOCKS**: If you find mock code, replace with real working implementations
- **REAL SYSTEM MONITORING**: Implement actual system metrics collection, not fake data
- **REAL THREAT PROCESSING**: Implement actual threat detection algorithms, not simulated responses
- **REAL AI INTEGRATIONS**: Implement actual AI model calls, not mock responses

- **REAL NETWORK CALLS**: Make actual HTTP/gRPC calls to external services
- **PRODUCTION READY**: All implementations must be production-ready, not demo code

### CENTRALIZED CONFIGURATION RULES - MASTER CONTROL COMPONENT
- **MANDATORY**: Use `pkg/config/` for ALL configuration and validation needs
- **NO LOCAL CONFIG**: Never create master-control-specific config/validation libraries
- **EXTEND SHARED**: Embed shared config types, add MCP-specific fields as needed
- **VALIDATION STANDARD**: Use `sharedconfig.ValidationErrors` for all validation
- **IMPORT PATTERN**: Always `import sharedconfig "pkg/config"`
- **CONTRIBUTE SPECIALIZED**: Add threat-processing validation to `pkg/config/` when needed
- **NO DUPLICATION**: Never reimplement port, timeout, range validation already in shared config
- **LOADER USAGE**: Use `sharedconfig.NewLoader()` for configuration loading

### GOLANG DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
- **Go Version**: Use Go 1.21+ features and syntax
- **Module Structure**: Each service is a separate Go module with its own `go.mod`
- **Package Naming**: Use lowercase, no underscores (e.g., `mastercontrol`, not `master_control`)
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors explicitly, never ignore with `_`
- **Context Usage**: Pass `context.Context` as first parameter in functions that need it
- **Logging**: Use structured logging with consistent fields

### ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS
- **Interface Design**: Define interfaces in the package that uses them
- **Dependency Injection**: Use constructor functions that accept dependencies
- **Configuration**: Use struct-based configuration with YAML tags
- **Service Communication**: Use gRPC for inter-service communication
- **Error Types**: Create custom error types for domain-specific errors

### TESTING STANDARDS
- **Test Files**: Use `_test.go` suffix
- **Test Structure**: Follow Table-Driven Tests pattern
- **Mocking**: Use interfaces for mocking dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Place in `tests/` directory

### SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
- **Input Validation**: Validate all external inputs
- **Error Messages**: Don't leak sensitive information in errors
- **Logging**: Don't log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, etc.)
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies up to date
