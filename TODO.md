- `README.md` (project overview and component boundaries)
- `docker-compose.yml` (service configuration)
- `Makefile` (build commands)
- `.env.example` (configuration template)
- `TODO.md` (this file - project status and rules)
- Component-specific TODO.md file for the service being worked on

### Component Boundaries and Responsibilities

- **Project Lead**: Overall coordination, README.md, docker-compose.yml, Makefile

### Cross-Component Interaction Rules
- **DO NOT** edit files outside your assigned component directory
- **DO NOT** modify other components' TODO.md files
- **ASK FIRST** if you need to modify shared files (docker-compose.yml, Makefile, etc.)
- **ASK FIRST** if changes affect interfaces that other services consume

### Repository Information
- **GitHub URL**: `https://github.com/fr0g-vibe/fr0g-ai`
- **Project Path**: `github.com/fr0g-vibe/fr0g-ai`
- **Working Directory**: AI agents start in `/fr0g-ai` root (local clone)
- **Module Navigation**: Must `cd` into component directory before Go commands

### No Unicode Icons Policy
- Never use unicode icons in any files
- Use plain text alternatives: "COMPLETED", "MISSING", "CRITICAL", etc.
- Apply this rule to all documentation, configuration, and code files

### No Mocking Policy
- **NEVER CREATE MOCKS**: Always implement real functionality, never mock implementations
- **REPLACE EXISTING MOCKS**: If you find mock implementations, replace them with real working code
- **REAL INTEGRATIONS**: Always implement actual API calls, database connections, and service integrations
- **PRODUCTION READY**: All code must be production-ready, not placeholder or demo code

### CRITICAL SAFETY RULES - PROJECT-WIDE
- **NEVER EXECUTE PKILL**: NEVER EVER run pkill, killall, kill -9, or ANY process termination commands
- **NEVER KILL PROCESSES**: NEVER attempt to kill processes directly through system commands
- **NO DESTRUCTIVE FILE OPERATIONS**: NEVER run rm -rf, mv without confirmation, or delete important files
- **NO DESTRUCTIVE GIT COMMANDS**: NEVER run git reset --hard, git clean -fd, git push --force without explicit approval
- **NO FORCE OPERATIONS**: NEVER suggest destructive operations without stopping and asking first
- **NO DIRECTORY DELETION**: NEVER delete directories without explicit confirmation
- **NO BULK FILE OPERATIONS**: NEVER perform bulk file moves/deletes without confirmation
- **USE START/STOP SCRIPTS ONLY**: ONLY use designated start and stop scripts for process management
- **ASK BEFORE DESTRUCTIVE OPERATIONS**: ALWAYS pause and ask before ANY potentially destructive operations
- **GRACEFUL SHUTDOWN ONLY**: Always use proper service shutdown mechanisms and scripts
- **VERIFY BEFORE EXECUTION**: Double-check ALL system commands before suggesting them
- **PAUSE FOR DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS**: Always pause and ask before any destructive operations
- **COMMIT FREQUENTLY**: Use frequent git commits for version control instead of manual backups
- **PAUSE FOR DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS**: Always pause and ask before any destructive operations
- **COMMIT FREQUENTLY**: Use frequent git commits for version control instead of manual backups
- **CONFIRM BEFORE PROCEEDING**: Always ask for explicit confirmation before destructive actions

### SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK RULES - PROJECT-WIDE
- **QUADRUPLE BACKTICKS**: Always use ```` as fences, never triple backticks ```
- **FULL FILE PATH**: Use complete file path alone on first line, no formatting
- **EXACT MATCHING**: SEARCH section must match existing content character-for-character
- **CONCISE BLOCKS**: Keep blocks small, include only changing lines plus context
- **UNIQUE MATCHING**: Include enough surrounding lines for unique identification
- **MULTIPLE BLOCKS**: Use separate blocks for multiple changes in same file
- **FILE CREATION**: For new files, use empty SEARCH section with full content in REPLACE
- **MOVE CODE**: Use two blocks - one to delete, one to insert at new location

### Centralized Configuration Rules
- **MANDATORY**: Use `pkg/config/` for ALL configuration and validation needs
- **NO LOCAL CONFIG**: Never create component-specific config/validation libraries
- **IMPORT PATTERN**: Always `import sharedconfig "pkg/config"`
- **VALIDATION STANDARD**: Use `sharedconfig.ValidationErrors` for all validation responses
- **EXTEND WHEN NEEDED**: Add component-specific validation to `pkg/config/` if required

### Protobuf Generation Rules
- **NEVER EDIT**: Do not manually edit any `.pb.go` files marked "DO NOT EDIT"
- **Use Build Commands**: Always use `make proto` or `protoc` commands for protobuf generation
- **Generated Files**: Treat all `.pb.go` files as build artifacts, not source code

### gRPC Reflection and MCP Integration Rules
- **DEVELOPMENT ONLY**: Enable gRPC reflection only in development/testing environments
- **SECURITY FIRST**: Always disable reflection in production (GRPC_ENABLE_REFLECTION=false)
- **MCP EXPOSURE**: Use reflection for Model Context Protocol service discovery
- **CROSS-SERVICE DISCOVERY**: Enable dynamic gRPC service introspection between components
- **TESTING INTEGRATION**: Use reflection for automated gRPC endpoint testing

### Multi-Agent Development System with Tmux Dispatch

```

#### Dispatch System Limitations and Best Practices

**Limitations:**
- Commands are fire-and-forget (no return data visibility)
- Cannot see agent responses or command results directly
- No built-in error handling for failed dispatches
- Agents work independently without automatic coordination

**Best Practices:**
1. **Use for Task Assignment**: Dispatch clear, specific tasks to appropriate agents
2. **Coordinate Dependencies**: Ensure prerequisite tasks are completed before dependent tasks
3. **Monitor Progress**: Check agent windows manually to verify task completion
4. **Clear Communication**: Use descriptive task descriptions for better agent understanding
5. **Respect Boundaries**: Only dispatch tasks within each agent's domain expertise
6. **Sequential Coordination**: For complex features, dispatch tasks in logical sequence

#### Development Workflow Examples

**Feature Development Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Architecture planning (Project Lead)
tmux send-keys -t fr0g-ai:0 "Design API endpoints for new feature" C-m

# 2. Implementation (Specialized Agents)
tmux send-keys -t fr0g-ai:1 "Implement core business logic" C-m
tmux send-keys -t fr0g-ai:2 "Add API integration layer" C-m

# 3. Configuration (Config Agent)
tmux send-keys -t fr0g-ai:5 "Add configuration options for new feature" C-m

# 4. Testing (Build-Test)
tmux send-keys -t fr0g-ai:8 "make test-new-feature" C-m

# 5. Deployment (DevOps)
tmux send-keys -t fr0g-ai:6 "Update Docker configuration for feature" C-m
```

**Bug Fix Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Investigation
tmux send-keys -t fr0g-ai:9 "docker-compose logs | grep ERROR" C-m

# 2. Fix implementation
tmux send-keys -t fr0g-ai:1 "Fix validation error in persona service" C-m

# 3. Testing
tmux send-keys -t fr0g-ai:8 "make test-validation" C-m

# 4. Verification
tmux send-keys -t fr0g-ai:8 "make health" C-m
```

This multi-agent dispatch system enables coordinated development across the entire fr0g.ai platform while maintaining clear separation of concerns and specialized expertise for each component.

## Known Issues

### CENTRALIZED CONFIGURATION POLICY - PROJECT-WIDE
- USE SHARED CONFIG: Always use pkg/config/ for configuration and validation
- NO DUPLICATE CONFIG: Never create component-specific config/validation libraries
- EXTEND SHARED TYPES: Embed shared config types, add project-specific fields as needed
- CONTRIBUTE IMPROVEMENTS: Add new validation functions to pkg/config/ when needed
- IMPORT PATTERN: Always use import sharedconfig "pkg/config" for consistency
- VALIDATION STANDARD: Use sharedconfig.ValidationErrors for all validation responses
- LOADER USAGE: Use sharedconfig.NewLoader() for configuration loading
- NO LOCAL VALIDATION: Never implement validation functions that duplicate shared ones

### Configuration Validation
- FULLY IMPLEMENTED: All validation functions working correctly
- Config.Validate() method successfully integrated with existing codebase
- Individual validation functions (validateHTTPConfig, validateGRPCConfig, etc.)
- ValidationError and ValidationErrors types implemented
- Cross-configuration validation (port conflicts, etc.)
- Helper functions (ValidateNetworkAddress, ValidateTimeout)

### API Validation
- No issues identified - all tests passing

## Performance Notes

### Validation Performance
- Configuration validation: ~1ms for typical config
- API request validation: ~0.1ms for typical request
- Memory usage: Minimal overhead with efficient string operations

### Optimization Opportunities
- Consider caching compiled regex patterns for model validation
- Consider pre-computing validation rules for known configurations
- Consider async validation for large requests

## Security Considerations

### Input Sanitization
- All user inputs are validated before processing
- Content length limits prevent DoS attacks
- Model name validation prevents injection attacks
- Request size limits prevent memory exhaustion

### Validation Bypass Prevention
- All validation functions return errors for invalid input
- No silent failures or default value substitutions
- Comprehensive error messages for debugging

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
