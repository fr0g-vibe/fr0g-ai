# fr0g.ai PROJECT STATUS - COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW

## PROJECT-WIDE AI DEVELOPMENT RULES

### Essential Context Files for AI Sessions
When starting new AI coding sessions, always include these files:
- `README.md` (project overview and component boundaries)
- `docker-compose.yml` (service configuration)
- `Makefile` (build commands)
- `.env.example` (configuration template)
- `TODO.md` (this file - project status and rules)
- Component-specific TODO.md file for the service being worked on

### Component Boundaries and Responsibilities
- **fr0g-ai-aip**: Core AI processing engine (ports 8080/9090)
- **fr0g-ai-bridge**: Integration bridge service (ports 8082/9091)  
- **fr0g-ai-master-control**: Orchestration and cognitive engine (port 8081)
- **Project Lead**: Overall coordination, README.md, docker-compose.yml, Makefile

### Cross-Component Interaction Rules
- **DO NOT** edit files outside your assigned component directory
- **DO NOT** modify other components' TODO.md files
- **ASK FIRST** if you need to modify shared files (docker-compose.yml, Makefile, etc.)
- **ASK FIRST** if changes affect interfaces that other services consume

### Repository Information
- **GitHub URL**: `https://github.com/fr0g-vibe/fr0g-ai`
- **Project Path**: `github.com/fr0g-vibe/fr0g-ai`
- **Working Directory**: AI agents start in `/fr0g-ai` root (local clone)
- **Module Navigation**: Must `cd` into component directory before Go commands

### No Unicode Icons Policy
- Never use unicode icons in any files
- Use plain text alternatives: "RESOLVED", "MISSING", "CRITICAL", etc.
- Apply this rule to all documentation, configuration, and code files

### No Mocking Policy
- **NEVER CREATE MOCKS**: Always implement real functionality, never mock implementations
- **REPLACE EXISTING MOCKS**: If you find mock implementations, replace them with real working code
- **REAL INTEGRATIONS**: Always implement actual API calls, database connections, and service integrations
- **PRODUCTION READY**: All code must be production-ready, not placeholder or demo code

### Centralized Configuration Rules
- **MANDATORY**: Use `pkg/config/` for ALL configuration and validation needs
- **NO LOCAL CONFIG**: Never create component-specific config/validation libraries
- **IMPORT PATTERN**: Always `import sharedconfig "pkg/config"`
- **VALIDATION STANDARD**: Use `sharedconfig.ValidationErrors` for all validation responses
- **EXTEND WHEN NEEDED**: Add component-specific validation to `pkg/config/` if required

### Protobuf Generation Rules
- **NEVER EDIT**: Do not manually edit any `.pb.go` files marked "DO NOT EDIT"
- **Use Build Commands**: Always use `make proto` or `protoc` commands for protobuf generation
- **Generated Files**: Treat all `.pb.go` files as build artifacts, not source code

### Tmux Agent Dispatch Capability (Project Lead Only)
The project lead can dispatch commands to specialized agent windows:
```bash
# Command Format:
tmux send-keys -t fr0g-ai:WINDOW_NUMBER "COMMAND" C-m

# Agent Window Mapping (Aider Chat Clients):
# Window 0: Project-Lead (architecture and coordination) - AIDER
# Window 1: AIP (fr0g-ai-aip core AI service) - AIDER
# Window 2: Bridge (fr0g-ai-bridge integration service) - AIDER
# Window 3: MCP (fr0g-ai-master-control cognitive engine) - AIDER
# Window 4: Config (configuration and environment management) - AIDER
# Window 5: DevOps (infrastructure and deployment) - AIDER

# Shell Windows (Direct Commands):
# Window 6: Build-Test (build automation and testing) - SHELL
# Window 7: Monitor (system monitoring and logs) - SHELL
# Window 8: Shell (general purpose interactive shell) - SHELL

# Example Dispatch Commands:
# To Aider agents (windows 0-5):
tmux send-keys -t fr0g-ai:1 "Implement persona service with CRUD operations" C-m
tmux send-keys -t fr0g-ai:2 "Add health check validation" C-m
tmux send-keys -t fr0g-ai:3 "Verify learning rate metrics" C-m

# To shell windows (windows 6-8):
tmux send-keys -t fr0g-ai:6 "make build-all" C-m
tmux send-keys -t fr0g-ai:7 "docker-compose logs -f" C-m
tmux send-keys -t fr0g-ai:8 "git status" C-m
```

**Dispatch Limitations:**
- Commands are fire-and-forget (no return data visibility)
- Cannot see agent responses or command results
- Use for task assignment and coordination only

## Known Issues

### CENTRALIZED CONFIGURATION POLICY - PROJECT-WIDE
- USE SHARED CONFIG: Always use pkg/config/ for configuration and validation
- NO DUPLICATE CONFIG: Never create component-specific config/validation libraries
- EXTEND SHARED TYPES: Embed shared config types, add project-specific fields as needed
- CONTRIBUTE IMPROVEMENTS: Add new validation functions to pkg/config/ when needed
- IMPORT PATTERN: Always use import sharedconfig "pkg/config" for consistency
- VALIDATION STANDARD: Use sharedconfig.ValidationErrors for all validation responses
- LOADER USAGE: Use sharedconfig.NewLoader() for configuration loading
- NO LOCAL VALIDATION: Never implement validation functions that duplicate shared ones

### Configuration Validation
- FULLY IMPLEMENTED: All validation functions working correctly
- Config.Validate() method successfully integrated with existing codebase
- Individual validation functions (validateHTTPConfig, validateGRPCConfig, etc.)
- ValidationError and ValidationErrors types implemented
- Cross-configuration validation (port conflicts, etc.)
- Helper functions (ValidateNetworkAddress, ValidateTimeout)

### API Validation
- No issues identified - all tests passing

## Performance Notes

### Validation Performance
- Configuration validation: ~1ms for typical config
- API request validation: ~0.1ms for typical request
- Memory usage: Minimal overhead with efficient string operations

### Optimization Opportunities
- Consider caching compiled regex patterns for model validation
- Consider pre-computing validation rules for known configurations
- Consider async validation for large requests

## Security Considerations

### Input Sanitization
- All user inputs are validated before processing
- Content length limits prevent DoS attacks
- Model name validation prevents injection attacks
- Request size limits prevent memory exhaustion

### Validation Bypass Prevention
- All validation functions return errors for invalid input
- No silent failures or default value substitutions
- Comprehensive error messages for debugging

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- All public functions have comprehensive comments
- Error messages are descriptive and actionable
- Test cases document expected behavior

### Usage Examples
- Test files serve as usage examples
- [ ] Add README with validation usage patterns
- [ ] Add API documentation with validation rules
