# Input/Output (I/O) Component Documentation

## Overview
The I/O component handles comprehensive input/output processing for all threat vectors and external communications within the fr0g.ai system.

## Responsibilities
- Input processing for multiple threat vectors (SMS, Voice, Email, IRC, Discord)
- Output processing and response automation
- Threat detection and analysis across all communication channels
- Message queuing and processing pipeline
- External API integration (Google Voice, Discord, etc.)
- Bidirectional communication with master-control for threat analysis

## Key Interfaces
- **Input**: Receives messages from external threat vectors
- **Output**: Sends responses and alerts through various channels
- **Master Control**: Sends events for analysis, receives processing commands
- **External APIs**: Integrates with SMS, Voice, Email, and messaging platforms

## Development Guidelines
### For I/O Engineers
- Focus on threat vector processing and external API integration
- Implement real-time message processing and queuing
- Handle external service authentication and rate limiting
- Manage bidirectional communication with master-control
- Implement comprehensive error handling for network failures

### Integration Points
- **Master Control**: Sends input events for threat analysis
- **External APIs**: Google Voice, Discord, IRC, SMTP servers
- **Service Registry**: Automatic registration and health monitoring

## Current Status
- **Input Processors**: All 5 processors operational (SMS, Voice, Email, IRC, Discord)
- **Output Framework**: Complete output manager with 4 processors registered
- **Message Queuing**: Memory-based queuing with Redis persistence planned
- **API Integration**: HTTP server on port 8083, gRPC on port 9092
- **Health Monitoring**: Service health checks and status reporting
- **Container Support**: Docker containerization with health checks

## Testing
- Unit tests for all processor types
- Integration tests with external APIs
- Load testing for message processing throughput
- End-to-end testing with master-control integration

## Configuration
- External API credentials and endpoints
- Message processing limits and timeouts
- Queue configuration and persistence settings
- Health check intervals and retry policies

## Security Features
- Input validation and sanitization for all message types
- API key management for external services
- Rate limiting to respect external API quotas
- Threat detection and quarantine capabilities
