# Master Control Component Documentation

## Overview
The Master Control component provides centralized configuration management, health monitoring, and system orchestration for the entire fr0g-ai-bridge application.

## Responsibilities
- System-wide configuration management
- Health monitoring and status reporting
- Component lifecycle management
- Logging and metrics aggregation
- Service discovery and coordination
- Graceful shutdown and restart procedures

## Key Interfaces
- **Configuration**: Provides configuration to Bridge and AI Persona components
- **Monitoring**: Collects health status from all components
- **Control**: Manages component startup, shutdown, and restart sequences

## Development Guidelines
### For Master Control Engineers
- Implement centralized configuration loading and distribution
- Design health check protocols and monitoring dashboards
- Handle component failure detection and recovery
- Manage system-wide logging and metrics collection
- Implement service discovery mechanisms

### System Design Principles
- Fail-fast configuration validation
- Graceful degradation on component failures
- Comprehensive system observability
- Zero-downtime configuration updates
- Automated recovery procedures
