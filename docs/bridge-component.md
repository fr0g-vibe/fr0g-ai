# Bridge Component Documentation

## Overview
The Bridge component serves as the communication layer between external clients and internal AI Persona functionality, providing both HTTP REST and gRPC interfaces.

## Responsibilities
- HTTP REST API endpoint management
- gRPC service implementation
- Request routing and load balancing
- Protocol translation between external and internal formats
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and request validation

## Key Interfaces
- **External**: HTTP REST API and gRPC services for client applications
- **Internal**: Communication with AI Persona component
- **Control**: Health reporting and configuration updates with Master Control

## Development Guidelines
### For Bridge Engineers
- Implement and maintain API endpoints (REST and gRPC)
- Handle request validation and sanitization
- Manage client authentication and session state
- Implement proper error handling and status codes
- Ensure API versioning and backward compatibility

### API Design Principles
- RESTful design for HTTP endpoints
- Consistent error response formats
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Comprehensive request/response logging
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

## Testing
- API endpoint testing (REST and gRPC)
- Load testing for concurrent requests
- Authentication and authorization tests
- Protocol conversion accuracy tests
- Error handling and edge case validation

## Configuration
- Server ports and binding addresses
- TLS/SSL certificate management
- Rate limiting thresholds
- Authentication provider settings
- Logging levels and formats
