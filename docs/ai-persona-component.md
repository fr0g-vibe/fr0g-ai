# AI Persona (AIP) Component Documentation

## Overview
The AI Persona component handles the core AI functionality and personality management within the fr0g-ai-bridge system.

## Responsibilities
- AI model interaction and response generation
- Persona configuration and behavior management
- Context management and conversation state
- AI prompt engineering and optimization

## Key Interfaces
- **Input**: Receives user queries and context from the Bridge component
- **Output**: Returns AI-generated responses to the Bridge component
- **Configuration**: Loads persona settings and AI model parameters

## Development Guidelines
### For AIP Engineers
- Focus on AI model integration and optimization
- Implement persona-specific behavior patterns
- Manage conversation context and memory
- Handle AI model switching and fallback logic

### Integration Points
- **Bridge Component**: Receives requests via standardized message format
- **Master Control**: Reports health status and receives configuration updates
