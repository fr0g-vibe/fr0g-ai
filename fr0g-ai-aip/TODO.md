### CROSS-COMPONENT INTERACTION RULES
- **DO NOT** edit files in `fr0g-ai-bridge/` or `fr0g-ai-master-control/` directories
- **DO NOT** modify other components' TODO.md files
- **ASK FIRST** if changes affect gRPC interfaces that other services consume
- **ASK FIRST** if you need to modify shared files (docker-compose.yml, Makefile, etc.)
- **BE AWARE** that other services depend on your gRPC interfaces

### PROJECT STRUCTURE RULES
- **Repository URL**: Always use `https://github.com/fr0g-vibe/fr0g-ai`
- **Project Path**: All Go imports use `github.com/fr0g-vibe/fr0g-ai/` prefix

- **Service Ports**: HTTP :8080, gRPC :9090 (configured in docker-compose)
- **Subproject Path**: This component exists at `github.com/fr0g-vibe/fr0g-ai/fr0g-ai-aip`

### PROTOBUF GENERATION RULES
- **NEVER EDIT**: Do not manually edit any `.pb.go` files marked "DO NOT EDIT"
- **Use Build Commands**: Always use `make proto` or `protoc` commands for protobuf generation
- **Generated Files**: Treat all `.pb.go` files as build artifacts, not source code
- **Source of Truth**: This component defines the core protobuf schemas for the project
- **Proto Files**: Only edit `.proto` source files, never the generated `.pb.go` files

### NO MOCKING POLICY - AIP COMPONENT

- **MANDATORY LINTING**: Always run `make lint` before committing any code changes
- **ZERO LINT ERRORS**: All code must pass golangci-lint without errors or warnings
- **FIX BEFORE COMMIT**: Never commit code that fails linting - fix all issues first
- **LINT EARLY**: Run `make lint` frequently during development, not just at the end
- **SHARED CONFIG**: Use centralized configuration from `pkg/config/` to avoid import errors

### SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK RULES - AIP COMPONENT
- **QUADRUPLE BACKTICKS**: Always use ```` as fences, never triple backticks ```
- **FULL FILE PATH**: Use complete file path alone on first line, no formatting
- **EXACT MATCHING**: SEARCH section must match existing content character-for-character

- **âœ… VERIFY BEFORE EXECUTION**: Double-check ALL system commands before suggesting them
- **âœ… PAUSE FOR DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS**: Always pause and ask before any destructive operations
- **âœ… COMMIT FREQUENTLY**: Use frequent git commits for version control instead of manual backups
- **âœ… PAUSE FOR DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS**: Always pause and ask before any destructive operations
- **âœ… COMMIT FREQUENTLY**: Use frequent git commits for version control instead of manual backups

### CENTRALIZED CONFIGURATION RULES - AIP COMPONENT
